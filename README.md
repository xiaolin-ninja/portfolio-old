This portfolio was built with ReactJS by [Shirley Xiaolin Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shxxu/).

I learn languages to connect with people all over the world. I communicate in Ruby, Python, SQL, JS, Spanish, Chinese, and English; I'm learning Go, C++, French, and German.

I am a back-end software engineer from San Francisco. I'm having a blast building and maintaining APIs & optimizing the scalability of a cloud application platform at Salesforce (Heroku), while learning to design secure systems at NYU (MS Cyber Security 2022). I hold a Master's of International Affairs from the University of California, specializing in Corporate Social Responsibility. I made the career switch to Software Engineering to chase dreams and challenge convention.

Assertive and accommodating, I seamlessly transition between support and leadership. I strive to create an honest & inclusive environment for my peers, and treat every experience as a learning opportunity.

Outside the office I'm a certified Pilates instructor, Krav Maga practitioner, and outdoor enthusiast with adventures in 20+ countries. Iâ€™m easier to get to know than to forget. :)
