This portfolio was built with ReactJS by [Shirley Xiaolin Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shxxu/).

Shirley is a full-stack software engineer located in San Francisco, CA. She is new to the industry and eager to learn.
She communicates in Python, JavaScript, SQL, Ruby, Spanish, Chinese, English, and French.

Shirley built this portfolio in a week, with no prior knowledge of React.
She created the web app [BudBud: A Buddy for Your Bud](https://github.com/xiaolin-ninja/BudBud) in 4 weeks, which features an extensive database of 140 cannabis strains and 60 dispensaries in the SF bay area. She learned to be a good programmer through the software engineering fellowship at [Hackbright Academy](https://hackbrightacademy.com/).

She is excited to combine her new skillset with a background in international business management to make a lasting impact on the world.
